## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the environment and run the chess engine on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2. Project Setup

1.  **Open the Project**: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the folder containing this project.
2.  **Python Extension**:
    * If you are opening this project for the first time, a prompt may appear in the bottom right asking to install the **Python Extension**.
    * Click **Yes/Install**. This is highly recommended for IntelliSense (code completion) and easier troubleshooting.

### 3. Install Dependencies

You need to install the `pygame` library to render the graphical interface.

1.  Open the Terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~` or go to **Terminal > New Terminal**).
2.  Run the installation command for your operating system:
